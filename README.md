# Biotest

Small examples of common filetypes for unit-testing bioinformatics frameworks.

All mutation data is either simulated, completely artificial, or subsampled somatic calls from publicly available cell lines.

Most files describe a single-sample. Samples describing a cohort, will be prefixed with 'cohort'.


## Mutations (Small Variants)

### VCFs

**tumor_normal.2sample.purple.pave.hg38.vcf**
>  - Example somatic mutations in typical tumor-normal VCF, as produced by oncoanalyser (purple enriched VCF calls). Filter status of some PASS variants was manually changed to 'readStrandBias' or '.'. Variants have been annotated with PAVE.

**tumor_normal.2sample.purple.minimal.hg38.vcf**
> - Removed INFO and FORMAT fields except for GT using `bcftools annotate -x "INFO,FORMAT"`

**tumor_normal.2sample.purple.minimal.vep.hg38.vcf**
> - VEP annotated (with identify canonical transcripts on).

**tumor.1sample.purple.pave.hg38.vcf**
> - Single sample version of `tumor_normal.2sample.purple.pave.hg38.vcf`. 'Normal' sample dropped using `bcftools -s tumor`


**tumor.1sample.purple.minimal.hg38.vcf**
> - More minimal version of `tumor_normal.2sample.purple.hg38.vcf` with INFO and FORMAT fields dropped using `bcftools annotate -x 'INFO,FORMAT'`. Only GT field remains.


**tumor.0sample.purple.minimal.hg38.vcf**
> - Minimal VCF with no sample information. Mutations describe a single sample whose ID is not described anywhere in the file.

**tumor.1sample.purple.vep.hg38.vcf**
> - Annotated with VEP (CSQ info field). See header for command
>  

**tumor.1sample.purple.vep_and_pave.hg38.vcf**
> - Annotated with VEP (CSQ info field). Pave annotations remain present. See `tumor.singlesample.purple.vep.hg38.vcf` for a VEP only version and 
> - Options: GRCh38.p14; GENCODE 48; Cache Version 114_GRCh38

### Tabular

**annovar.hg38.txt** & **annovar.hg38.csv**
> - Annovar annotation files generated by running  `tumor.singlasample.purple.hg38.vcf` through wAnnovar (tsv and csv version)


**chromposrefalt.1based.hg38.tsv**
> - Minimal Tabular Variant Format (pass only).
> 
> `bcftools view -f PASS -H tumor.singlesample.purple.minimal.hg38.vc
f | cut -f1,2,4,5 | awk 'BEGIN{print "Chromosome","Position","Ref","Alt"}{print $0}' OFS="\t" | head > chromposrefalt.1based.hg38.tsv`


## Mutations (Structural Variants)


### VCFs

**tumor_normal.2sample.purple.sv.hg38.vcf**
> - purple somatic SVs (PASS & INFERRED). Oncoanalyser Output.

**tumor.1sample.purple.sv.hg38.vcf**
> - somatic SVs (PASS & INFERRED) with only 1 sample (tumor sample) described.

**tumor.0sample.purple.sv.hg38.vcf**
> - somatic SVs (PASS & INFERRED) describing a single sample, with no sample ID in VCF.

### Tabular

 **purple.sv.breakpoints.hg38.bedpe**
> - Somatic breakpoints from `tumor_normal.2sample.purple.sv.hg38.vcf`. Does not include single breakends, where second breakpoint could not be found. See `scripts/sv_vcf_to_tabular.R` for code to reproduce.

 **purple.sv.breakends.hg38.bed**
 > - Somatic single breakends from `tumor_normal.2sample.purple.sv.hg38.vcf`. Does not include SVs where both ends of breakpoint are found. Score of breakends inferred by copynumnber change are set to zero. See `scripts/sv_vcf_to_tabular.R` for code to reproduce.  

## Mutations (Copy Number Variants)

**purple.cnv.somatic.hg38.tsv**
> - Copy number profile of all (contiguous) segments of a tumor sample

**cohort.3sample.purple.hg38.tsv**
> - Cohort segment file. Contains three samples with identical copynumber profiles (`purple.cnv.somatic.hg38.tsv` triplicated)
